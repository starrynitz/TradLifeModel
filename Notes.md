This project is an attempt to build an actuarial model using Julia with the intention to learn and practice coding in Julia at the same time. Many aspects of the models have not been well thought out in advance. The tool has also not been tested and therefore errors will likely occur when using it.

The project was built on actuarial and non-actuarial related concepts which I have learnt from the open source community. I'm really grateful for these valuable knowledge kindly shared by the community.

If you are interested to build your own actuarial model using Julia as well, you may refer to [JuliaActuary](https://juliaactuary.org), where you will find very comprehensive resources on learning and using Julia for actuarial work. It also provides many actuarial packages that can make the modelling journey a lot easier, as it did for mine.
